# Problem Statement

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.

# Data Cleaning and Transformation

Because the data has Null and uncorect format type so I need to do data cleaning and transformation before using SQL to extract data to answer questions.

## 1. Table: Customer Order

I create temp table name 'customer_orders_temp' to replace null value with blank value

````sql

CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_orders_temp AS
SELECT 
  order_id, 
  customer_id, 
  pizza_id, 
  CASE
	  WHEN exclusions IS null OR exclusions LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  ELSE exclusions
	  END AS exclusions,
  CASE
	  WHEN extras IS NULL or extras LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  ELSE extras
	  END AS extras,
	order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;

````
## 2. Table: runner_orders

I create temp table name 'runner_orders_temp' to replace null value with blank value and remove uneccesary charaters from data.

````sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE runner_orders_temp AS
SELECT 
  order_id, 
  runner_id,  
  CASE
	  WHEN pickup_time LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  ELSE pickup_time
	  END AS pickup_time,
  CASE
	  WHEN distance LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  WHEN distance LIKE '%km' THEN TRIM('km' from distance)
	  ELSE distance 
    END AS distance,
  CASE
	  WHEN duration LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM('mins' from duration) 
	  WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM('minute' from duration) 
	  WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM('minutes' from duration) 
	  ELSE duration
	  END AS duration,
  CASE
	  WHEN cancellation IS NULL or cancellation LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  ELSE cancellation
	  END AS cancellation
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;

````
Other tables I keep the same schema.

5. From count_pizza_delivered filter maximum value of count_pizza_delivered column to answer what was the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order.

#### Results:
| max_pizza_delivered_single_order |
| 3                                |

the maximum number of pizzas delivered in a single order was 3 pizzas.

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
````sql

where runner.cancellation not like '%Cancellation';
````
#### Steps:
1. Merge table customer_orders_temp with runner_orders_temp to get the data of cancellation
2. Filter the orders not have cancellation in delivery.
3. Calculate sum to sum all pizza have both exclusions and extras by each customer to answer how many pizzas were delivered that had both exclusions and extras.

#### Results:
| pizza_deivered_both_exclusion_and_extras_count |
| ---------------------------------------------- |
| 1                                              |

     Select *,
     extract(hour from order_time) as hour_of_day
     from customer_orders_temp)
Select hour_of_day,
       count(order_id) as total_volume_pizza_ordered_each_hour
from hour_of_day_ordered
group by hour_of_day
order by hour_of_day asc;
````
#### Steps:
1. Extract hour from order_time of customer_orders_temp to get hour information.
2. Create a CTE name 'hour_of_day_ordered'
3. From 'hour_of_day_ordered' table, group by hour_of_day to count the number of order each hour of day to answer what was the total volume of pizzas ordered for each hour of the day
4. Order by hour_of_day ascending order.

#### Results:
| hour_of_day | total_volume_pizza_ordered_each_hour |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| 11          |	1                                    |
| 13          | 3                                    |
| 18  	      | 3                                    |
| 19	      | 1                                    |

Busy hour with highest pizzas ordered was 13:00, 18:00, 21:00, and 23:00 with 3 pizzas ordered at those time.

### 10. What was the volume of orders for each day of the week?
````sql
with order_time_timestamp as (Select *,
     cast(order_time as timestamp) as order_time_timestamp
     from customer_orders_temp)
Select TO_CHAR(order_time_timestamp + INTERVAL '2 days', 'Day') AS day_of_week, 
       COUNT(order_id) AS total_pizza_ordered
FROM order_time_timestamp
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(order_time_timestamp + INTERVAL '2 days', 'Day')
order by total_pizza_ordered desc;
````

#### Steps:
