# Problem Statement

Danny seriously loves Japanese food so in the beginning of 2021, he decides to embark upon a risky venture and opens up a cute little restaurant that sells his 3 favourite foods: sushi, curry and ramen.


Danny’s Diner is in need of your assistance to help the restaurant stay afloat - the restaurant has captured some very basic data from their few months of operation but have no idea how to use their data to help them run the business.


Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money they’ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.


Danny has provided us with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for us to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions.

# Questions and my solutions

**1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?**

````sql

Select sales.customer_id,
       sum(price) as total_spent
from dannys_diner.sales as sales
join dannys_diner.menu as menu on sales.product_id = menu.product_id
group by sales.customer_id
order by sales.customer_id asc;

````
## Steps:

1. Use join to merge dannys_diner.sales with dannys_diner.menu on product_id to get the price of dishes on dannys_diner.menu table.
2. Group sales.customer_id to calculate sum of price by customer_id to get total amount each customer spent at the restaurant.
3. Order by sales.customer_id to display the data ascending by customer_id

## Results:
| customer_id | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

Customer A spent 76$ at the restaurant


Customer B spent 74$ at the restaurant


Customer C spent 36$ at the restaurant

**2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?**

````sql

Select sales.customer_id,
       count(distinct order_date) as number_day_customer_visited
       from dannys_diner.sales
       group by sales.customer_id
       order by sales.customer_id asc;

````
## Steps:

1. Group sales.customer_id to calculate count distinct order date by customer_id to get total days each customer visited the restaurant.
   
2. Order by sales.customer_id to display the data ascending by customer_id.

## Results:
| customer_id	| number_day_customer_visited |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
|A            | 4                           |
|B	       | 6                           |
|C            | 2                           |

Customer A has visỉted the restaurant 4 days

Customer B has visỉted the restaurant 6 days

Customer C has visỉted the restaurant 2 days

**3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?**

````sql

with order_date_rank as (
       Select customer_id,
       order_date,
       dense_rank() over(order by order_date asc) as order_date_rank,
       product_name
       from dannys_diner.sales as sales
       inner join dannys_diner.menu as menu on sales.product_id = menu.product_id
       order by customer_id asc, order_date_rank asc)
Select distinct customer_id,
	   product_name
from order_date_rank
where order_date_rank = 1;

````
## Steps:

1. Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) with name 'order_date_rank', create new column order_date_rank using dense_rank() to rank by the order_date ascending from the merge table between sales and menu.
   
2. From 'order_date_rank' CTE table, select distinct customer_id with filter order_date_rank = 1 to find the first item from the menu purchased by each customer.

## Results:

| customer_id	| product_name |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| A	       | curry        |
| A	       | sushi        |
| B	       | curry        |
| C	       | ramen        |

Customer A placed an order for both curry and sushi simultaneously, making them the first items in the order.

Customer B's first order is curry.

Customer C's first order is ramen.

**4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?**

````sql

Select menu.product_name,
       sales.product_id,
       count(sales.product_id) as most_purchased_product
from dannys_diner.sales as sales
inner join dannys_diner.menu as menu on sales.product_id = menu.product_id
group by menu.product_name,sales.product_id
order by most_purchased_product desc limit 1;
Select menu.product_name,
       count(product_name) as total_time_purchased
from dannys_diner.sales as sales
inner join dannys_diner.menu as menu on sales.product_id = menu.product_id
group by menu.product_name
order by menu.product_name asc;

````
## Steps:

1. Write inner join dannys_diner.menu with dannys_diner.sales on product_id to get the product_name on menu table.
   
2. Group by menu.product_name, sales.product_id to calculate count product_id, finding the most purchased item on the menu by all customers.
 
3. group by menu.product_name to calculate count product_name, finding how many times the products were purchased by all customer.

## Results:

| product_name | product_id | most_purchased_product |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------------------- |
| ramen        | 3	    | 8                      |

| product_name | total_time_purchased |
| ------------ | -------------------- |
| curry	       | 4                    |
| ramen	       | 8                    |
| sushi	       | 3                    |

 Most purchased item on the menu is ramen which is 8 times

 Total purchased for curry is 4 times

 Total purchased for ramen is 8 times

 Total purchased for sushi is 8 times

 **5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?**
 
 ````sql
with rank_item_purchased as (
       Select sales.customer_id,
       menu.product_name,
       dense_rank() over(partition by sales.customer_id order by count(product_name) asc) as rank_item_purchased
       from dannys_diner.sales as sales
       inner join dannys_diner.menu as menu on sales.product_id = menu.product_id
       group by sales.customer_id, menu.product_name
       order by customer_id asc, product_name asc)
Select customer_id,
	   product_name,
       rank_item_purchased
from rank_item_purchased
where rank_item_purchased = 1
order by customer_id asc, product_name asc;

 ````
## Steps:
1. Create a Common Table Expression (CTE) named `rank_item_purchased` to rank item_ purchased by each customer from merge table between sales and menu table on product_id.
2. From 'rank_item_purchased' table select customer_id and product_name with filter rank_item_purchased = 1 to filter the first rank in the product each customer bought.
3. Order by customer_id and product_name in ascending orders.

## Results:


| customer_id | product_name | rank_item_purchased |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| A           |	sushi        |	1                  |
| B           |	curry        | 	1                  |
| B           |	ramen        |	1                  |
| B           |	sushi        |	1                  |
| C           |	ramen        |	1                  |
