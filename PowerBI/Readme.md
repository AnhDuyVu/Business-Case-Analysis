# 3. Results
# 3.1 General Business Situation

In general, revenue has been steadily increasing from 2011 to the end of 2014, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.45%. However, within each year, revenue tends to increase steadily across all categories until the fourth quarter, after which it sharply declines in the first quarter of the following year.

The gross profit margin remains stable at around 11% throughout the four years.

The value of individual orders does not vary significantly over the years, while the number of orders shows a strong upward trend (increasing 1.7 times in 2014), contributing to the overall revenue growth of the company. The value of return orders tends to increase slightly over the years, with an average value that is 1.3 times higher than successful orders. The company focuses on markets such as APAC (27.66%), US (19.14%), EU (22.77%), and LATAM (16.64%).

The B2C customer group is the main source of revenue for the company (51%), followed by Corporate (29.4%) and Home Office (18.89%). However, in recent years, revenue from this customer group has been trending slightly downward. The revenue structure in 2014 indicates a rising trend in revenue from the Home Office customer group.

# 3.2 Market

The top three markets that generate the main revenue are APAC (3.59M, accounting for 27.66%), EU (2.94M, accounting for 22.77%), and US (2.3M, accounting for 19.14%). The distribution of the three categories is fairly even in most markets, but products in the Technology category still hold the largest share.

The popular products in these markets are Bookcases, Phones, and Chairs, respectively. In the EU, Copiers specifically contribute the highest revenue.

In terms of compound annual growth rate (CAGR), Canada is experiencing the strongest growth (28.45%), followed by Africa (22.14%), despite being the two markets with the lowest revenue. Although the US is one of the three major markets, it has the slowest growth rate, at approximately 10%.

Considering the countries, the United States is the country that generates the highest revenue (2.2M), which is 2.4 times higher than the second-ranked country.

# 3.3 Products

All categories of the company have a seasonal nature, with significant revenue growth towards the end of the year. The Technology and Office Supplies categories have the highest Gross Profit Margin (13.99% and 13.69%, respectively), which is double that of the Furniture category with a margin of only 6.94%. The following sub-categories generate the highest revenue: Phones (1.7M), Copiers (1.5M), Chairs (1.5M), and Bookcases (1.4M).

The following sub-categories have the highest Profit Margin: Paper (24.24%), Labels (20.45%), Envelopes (17.32%), Accessories (17.29%), and Copier (17.13%). However, among them, only Copiers and Accessories have high revenue. The remaining products belong to the five lowest revenue-generating products in the company.

Notably, Tables are the only product with a negative Profit Contribution (-4.45%) despite having a relatively high revenue (749K).

# 3.4 Recommendations
Conduct research to understand the reasons for the usual revenue decline at the beginning of the year in order to develop appropriate business strategies.
Continue to leverage business strategies in major markets such as APAC and EU, while expanding and exploring strategies for developing potential markets (with high CAGR) such as Canada and Africa. In the US, although it is a large market, the growth rate is slow, so a new business strategy is needed.
