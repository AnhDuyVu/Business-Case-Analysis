# Problem Statement

Danny was sold on the idea, but he knew that pizza alone was not going to help him get seed funding to expand his new Pizza Empire - so he had one more genius idea to combine with it - he was going to Uberize it - and so Pizza Runner was launched!

Danny started by recruiting “runners” to deliver fresh pizza from Pizza Runner Headquarters (otherwise known as Danny’s house) and also maxed out his credit card to pay freelance developers to build a mobile app to accept orders from customers.

He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.

# Data Cleaning and Transformation

Because the data has Null and uncorect format type so I need to do data cleaning and transformation before using SQL to extract data to answer questions.

## 1. Table: Customer Order

I create temp table name 'customer_orders_temp' to replace null value with blank value

````sql

CREATE TEMP TABLE customer_orders_temp AS
SELECT 
  order_id, 
  customer_id, 
  pizza_id, 
  CASE
	  WHEN exclusions IS null OR exclusions LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  ELSE exclusions
	  END AS exclusions,
  CASE
	  WHEN extras IS NULL or extras LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  ELSE extras
	  END AS extras,
	order_time
FROM pizza_runner.customer_orders;

````
## 2. Table: runner_orders

I create temp table name 'runner_orders_temp' to replace null value with blank value and remove uneccesary charaters from data.

````sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE runner_orders_temp AS
SELECT 
  order_id, 
  runner_id,  
  CASE
	  WHEN pickup_time LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  ELSE pickup_time
	  END AS pickup_time,
  CASE
	  WHEN distance LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  WHEN distance LIKE '%km' THEN TRIM('km' from distance)
	  ELSE distance 
    END AS distance,
  CASE
	  WHEN duration LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  WHEN duration LIKE '%mins' THEN TRIM('mins' from duration) 
	  WHEN duration LIKE '%minute' THEN TRIM('minute' from duration) 
	  WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes' THEN TRIM('minutes' from duration) 
	  ELSE duration
	  END AS duration,
  CASE
	  WHEN cancellation IS NULL or cancellation LIKE 'null' THEN ''
	  ELSE cancellation
	  END AS cancellation
FROM pizza_runner.runner_orders;

````
Other tables I keep the same schema.

## B. Runner and Customer Experience
### 1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)
````sql
Select 
       extract(week from registration_date) as registration_week,
       count(runner_id) as count_runners
from pizza_runner.runners
group by extract(week from registration_date)
order by registration_week asc;
````
#### Steps:
1. Group weeks from registration_date
2. Extract week from registration_date and count number of runner_id by week to get answer how many runners signed up for each 1 week period.

| 2	            | 1             |
| 3                 | 1             |

On week 1 of Jan 2021, 2 runners has signed up

On week 2 and 3 of Jan 2021, 1 runners has signed up

### 2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?
````sql
with pickup_order_duration_time as (Select *,
       to_timestamp(pickup_time,'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') as pickup_time_timestamp,
       DATE_PART('minute',to_timestamp(pickup_time,'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') - order_time) as pickup_order_duration_time
from customer_orders_temp as orders
join runner_orders_temp as runner on orders.order_id = runner.order_id)
Select runner_id,
       avg(pickup_order_duration_time) as average_time_to_Pizza_Runner_HQ
from pickup_order_duration_time
group by runner_id
order by runner_id asc;
````
#### Steps:
1. Merge table ustomer_orders_temp with runner_orders_temp on order_id to get pickup_time.
2. From merge table, extract pickup_time, duration_time = pickup_time - order_time.
3. Create a CTE table name 'pickup_order_duration_time'.
4. From 'pickup_order_duration_time' table group information by runner_id.
5. Calculate average picup_order_duration_time to answer what was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order.
6. Order by runner_id ascending order.

#### Results:
| runner_id | average_time_to_pizza_runner_hq |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1	    | 15.333333333333334              |
| 2	    | 15.833333333333334              |
| 3	    | 3.5                             |

Runner 1 took average 15.33 minutes to get to pizza runner HQ to pickup the order
Runner 2 took average 15.83 minutes to get to pizza runner HQ to pickup the order
Runner 3 took average 3.5 minutes to get to the pizza runner HQ to pickup the order

### 3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?
````sql
with pizza_order as (Select orders.order_id,
                            count(orders.order_id) as pizza_order,
                            order_time,
                            pickup_time,
                            abs(date_part('minute',to_timestamp(pickup_time,'YYYY-MM-DD HH24:MI:SS') - 
                                          order_time)) as order_prepare_time
from customer_orders_temp as orders
join runner_orders_temp as runner on orders.order_id = runner.order_id
where distance!=''
group by orders.order_id, order_time, pickup_time )
Select pizza_order,
       avg(order_prepare_time) as average_order_prepare_in_minutes
from pizza_order
group by pizza_order
order by pizza_order asc;
````
#### Steps:
1. To take the compare between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare, we compare the the number of pizzas and average order prepare time to find out any relationship
2. Merge table customer_orders_temp and runner_orders_temp on order_id
3. Filter the information within distance is not null
4. Group by order_id, order_time, pickup_time
5. Count the number of pizza_order and extract minutes from prepare_time = pickup_time - order_time
6. Create a CTE table name 'pizza_order'
7. From 'pizza_order' group by pizza_order
8. Extract pizza_order, calcuate average order_prepare_time to answer Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepar

#### Results:

| pizza_order | average_order_prepare_in_minutes |
| ----------- | -------------------------------- |
| 1    	      | 12                               |
| 2	      | 18                               |
| 3	      | 29                               |

As result, there is a correlation between the number of pizza orders with the prepare time of orders. We can see as pizza order increase, the average_rder_prepare increase.

### 4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
````sql
Select customer_id,
       round(avg(cast(distance as numeric)),2) as avg_distance_travel
from customer_orders_temp as orders
join runner_orders_temp as runner on orders.order_id = runner.order_id
where distance!=''
group by customer_id
order by customer_id asc;
````
#### Steps:
1. Merge talbe customer_orders_temp with runner_orders_temp on order_id
2. Filter order within distance is not null
3. Group by customer_id
4. Extract customer_id, calculate average distance travel by each customer

#### Results:
| customer_id | avg_distance_travel |
| ----------- | ------------------- |
| 101	      | 20.00               |
| 102	      | 16.73               |
| 103	      | 23.40               |
| 104	      | 10.00               |
| 105	      | 25.00               |

### 5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
````sql
Select (max(cast(duration as decimal))-min(cast(duration as decimal))) as  
        difference_delivery_times_in_minute_all_order
from customer_orders_temp as orders
join runner_orders_temp as runner on orders.order_id = runner.order_id
where distance!='';
````
#### Steps:
1. Merge table customer_orders_temp with runner_orders_temp on order_id to get information of duration
2. Filter the orders with distance is not null
3. Extract duration between the longest and shortest delivery times of all orders.

#### Results:

| difference_delivery_times_in_minute_all_order |
| --------------------------------------------- |
| 30                                            |

The difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders is 30 minutes

### 6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?
````sql
Select orders.order_id,
       runner_id,
       round(avg(cast(distance as decimal)/(cast(duration as decimal)/60)),2) as average_speed_delivery

join runner_orders_temp as runner on orders.order_id = runner.order_id
where distance!=''
group by orders.order_id, runner_id
order by orders.order_id asc, runner_id asc;
````
#### Steps:
1. Merge customer_orders_temp with runner_orders_temp on order_id
2. Filter the orders with distance is not null
3. Group by order_id and runner_id
4. Extract order_id, runner_id, average speed in each order and each runner to answer the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values
5. Order by order_id and runner_id ascending

#### Results:
| order_id | runner_id | average_speed_delivery |
| -------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| 1	   | 1	       | 37.50                  |
| 2	   | 1	       | 44.44                  |
| 3	   | 1	       | 40.20                  |
| 4	   | 2	       | 35.10                  |
| 5	   | 3	       | 40.00                  |
| 7	   | 2	       | 60.00                  |
| 8	   | 2	       | 93.60                  |
| 10	   | 1	       | 60.00                  |

### 7.  What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?
````sql
Select runner_id, 
  ROUND(100 * SUM(
    CASE WHEN distance = '' THEN 0
    ELSE 1 END) / COUNT(*), 0) AS successful_delivery_percentage
FROM runner_orders_temp
GROUP BY runner_id
order by runner_id asc;
````
#### Steps:
1. From runner_orders_temp group by runner_id
2. Extract runner_id, sum distance in each runner_id with have no distance and existed distance
3. Divide it to all the orders to answer What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner
4. Order by runner_id ascending

#### Results:
| runner_id | successful_delivery_percentage |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| 1	    | 100                            |
| 2	    | 75                             |
| 3	    | 50                             |
