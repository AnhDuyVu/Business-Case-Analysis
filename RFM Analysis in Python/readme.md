# 4. Insigts
Suggest recommendation for marketing team to target customers in campaign
The potential customer segments for the company's marketing campaign are as follows:

1. Potential Loyalist: This customer segment represents the largest portion of customers (14.9%), consisting of 118 customers who made their most recent purchases within 45 days (ranked 5th). Although they contribute a relatively small revenue of $1,345.49, the marketing team should consider implementing cross-selling strategies for this customer segment.

2. Champion: The second-largest customer segment (13.1%) includes 104 customers who made their most recent purchases within 27 days (ranked 2nd). They contribute the highest average revenue of $4,435.91. This segment consists of customers who make frequent purchases, so there should be priority customer care programs for this segment, such as product discounts.

3. Loyal: This customer segment has a relatively low proportion (8.6%) with an average purchase frequency of 7.7 days, but they contribute the second-highest revenue of $3,948.21. To further assess the products for this segment, conducting product evaluation surveys is recommended in order to create suitable cross-selling and up-selling programs.

4. Cannot Lose Them: This customer segment has the lowest proportion (4.7%), but they have a higher purchase frequency than the "Loyal" segment (4.78 > 7.75). However, these customers made transactions 265 days ago. Therefore, new campaign strategies based on rewards, discounts, and special incentives for this customer group can be planned to attract and retain them. These strategies could be designed to make them feel special and appealing, ultimately encouraging their loyalty.
